# Nooks
## Summary
Nooks is an "at-a-glance" system enumeration and exploration script for Linux. This script was intended to be a first-step tool for CTFs once a machine has been compromised and a foothold has been established. Nooks is mainly for getting a quick idea of where to look and what is unique about the machine all while other more sophisticated tools are transferred in the background.

## Future Goals
- Multiple OS support
- More sophisticated directory and file enumeration
- DB service enumeration
- Quick password searching
